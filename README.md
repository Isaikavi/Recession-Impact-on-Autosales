# Recession-Impact-on-Autosales

Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the impact of recession on sales across automobile categories and price ranges. 

Dataset Details
The dataset contains automobile sales statistics, such as make, model, year, and price, along with the economic factors that may have influenced these trends.

Actions Performed
  1. Data Collection & Loading: Imported the dataset containing automobile sales statistics and loaded it into a pandas DataFrame.
  2. Data Cleaning & Wrangling: Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and dealing with outliers.
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA to identify patterns and correlations in the dataset, including sales trends, prices, and the impact of the recession.
  4. Visualization: Created various visualizations (bar charts, line plots, and histograms) to showcase the relationships between the recession and sales numbers, as well as to analyze the distribution of auto sales data.
  5. Trend Analysis: Investigated the effects of the recession on different automobile categories (e.g., SUVs, Sedans) and analyzed how sales fluctuated over time.

Key Results
  1. Sales Decline: A noticeable dip in sales occurred around the 2008 recession period, with a slow recovery starting in 2010.
  2. Model Popularity: SUVs and Sedans were the most popular vehicle types, but luxury cars saw a bigger drop in sales during the recession.
  3. Price Trend: Car prices followed a cyclical trend, with significant price drops post-recession and slow recovery thereafter.
  4. Correlations: Higher-priced vehicles showed a stronger correlation with the sales decline during the recession compared to budget-friendly models.

Conclusion
  1. The analysis confirms that  recession had a substantial impact on automobile sales, with higher-end vehicle sales experiencing the most significant drop. 
  2. By understanding the trends and correlations, automotive businesses and industry stakeholders can use these insights to make more informed decisions regarding pricing strategies, marketing campaigns, and product development during economic downturns.
